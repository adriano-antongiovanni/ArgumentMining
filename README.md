classification

## About the Files:

Those files are part of the final paper for my Mechatronics degree at University of SÃ£o Paulo. 
They implement an test for using Trnasformers in the task of classifying argumentative phrases in relation to a topic

## Links needed to run the Files:

There are two main assets needed to fully run thoses programs that couldn't be uploaded here: 
- The benchmark dataset "IBM Debater - Claims Stance Dataset", avaiable [here](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml)
- Access to the IBM Debater API. You can request it [here](https://research.ibm.com/interactive/project-debater/)
